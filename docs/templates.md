# Templates

## iForum templates
iForum contains many, many templates to handle all the different use cases that can come up. We practice the DRY principle (don't repeat yourself) and as such there is much re-use and inclusion of templates here and there. 

That can make it difficult to identify where a certain page part is generated.

This page should help you along, by giving as much information about the different pages, the templates used and how the templates relate to each other.
